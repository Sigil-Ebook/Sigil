Primarily Infrastructure Changes Toward Dual Epub2 / Epub3 support:

Sigil 0.8.900 (pre Sigil 0.9.0 series)
    - Kill tidy and replace it with a combination of a specially modified Gumbo
         parser that supports html5
    - Kill Xerces and XercesExtras.
    - Kill Boost, replace with C++ 11
    - Kill unused bundles.
    - Replace all "undefined - behaviour" use of "Null" References with proper
         pointers across entire codebase to allow it to work with the latest
         clang compilers
    - Completely revamp the build process to embed the Python 3.4 Interpreter
         inside of Sigil and integrate it in, including as site-packages:
         [lxml, bs4, PIL, regex, six, html5lib].  This will allow plugins
         that use the internal Python 3.X engine access to all of these
         specialized packaes by default with no additional action
         needed by end users of their plugin.
    - Create our own version of BeautifulSoup4-4.4.0 called sigil_bs4 that
         fixes lxml namespace bugs, fixes serialization/prettyprinting of
         inline xhtml tags, and modifies the bs4 codebase so that a single
         sourcecode works equally well on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.X
    - Replace internal opf and ncx xml processing and cleaning with a
         combination of embedded Python 3.4, sigil_bs4 / lxml
    - Build hunspell as a shared library and then add a ctypes interface to allow
         plugins to spellcheck
    - Build our modified gumbo html5 parser as a shared library
         and provide a bs4 ctypes interface to it for easy xhtml processing
         in plugins that use Python 2.7 and Python 3.X
    - Allow plugins to auto-fix "text/html" media-types to "application/xhtml+xml"
    - Redesign the ebook source updates upon load process to use our modified
         gumbo-parser
    - Begin the transition to allow for both epub2 and epub3 editing
         (Note: epub3 editing is still incomplete)
    - Convert Flightcrew to become a Sigil plugin and replace it with
         a simple and fast internal sanity checker.
    - Update Hunspell dictionaries to be actual dictioanries and not word lists for en_US and en_GB
    - Updated other dictionaries to their most current version to match what is used in LibreOffice 5
    - Fix issue #54 modified date using local numerials when it should be
         using Arabic numerals per the spec.
    - Set the book to modified when font's are obfuscated.
    - Change FORCE_BUNDLED_COPIES build flag to USE_SYSTEM_LIBS. This flips
         the meaning of the flag. Now USE_SYSTEM_LIBS will enable using system
         libraries. Also, SYSTEM_LIBS_REQUIRED was added which will fail the
         cmake configure if any system libraries are not found instead of
         falling back to the bundled copy. Finally, this makes the build more
         consistent for Windows and OS X users.

      FolderKeeper.
    - Attempt to prevent Tidy from simply deleting all mathml during cleaning.

    - Fix text resource not alwalys saving to disk.
    - Fix bug in missing CSS.

      regardless if the user clicked no instead of yes.

    - the user can now edit the NCX file by hand (issue #282)
    - the OPF file is now preserved on import (issue #586)
    - the NCX file is now preserved on import (issue #283)
    - the Table Of Contents editor has been replaced with a new Table of Contents sidebar;
    clicking on an item in this sidebar takes the user to the target location, enabling TOC
    navigation (issue #100)
    - a dialog now informs the user if his XHTML, NCX or OPF documents are not well-formed
    XML (with error location and description), thus allowing him to fix the potential problems
    by hand instead of leaving them to Tidy to fix (issue #519)
    - fixed a rare issue with no tab opened by default when loading epubs
    - made the sigil.sh startup script more robust (courtesy of Craig Sanders) (issue #737)

Sigil v0.3.4 2011.01.12.
    - fixed a regression ("Not a folder" error) with opening certain epub files on Mac and
    Linux systems (issue #731)

Sigil v0.3.3 2011.01.06.
    - added a small "Donate" button to the toolbar and a related entry in the Help menu
    - added a .desktop file for the make install target (courtesy of Richard Gibert)
    - this time *really* worked around a Tidy bug that added blank lines to the start of <pre>
    and <style> elements (issue #655)
    - updated ZipArchive from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0
    - fixed a regression crash bug with loading extremely rare HTML content documents that have
    an internal DTD subset
    - added a workaround for a crash bug caused by invalid epubs that use obfuscated fonts but
    with incorrect UUID URN key syntax (issue #709)
    - integrated the FlightCrew epub validation library; a new toolbar icon triggers epub
    validation and displays the results (issue #28)
    - fixed a rare input truncation problem when the input file contains a unicode nbsp and also
    specifies standalone="yes" in the XML declaration (issue #677)

Sigil v0.3.2 2010.11.24.
    - added a new toolbar button for turning Tidy cleaning on/off; this option is also available
    from the Tools menu (issue #553)
    - added support for TrueType Collection fonts with extension TTC
    - InDesign (as of CS5) refuses to list the fonts it embeds in the OPF manifest of the epub
    files it exports, even though the epub standard demands it. This causes Sigil to not pick up
    these fonts when opening such epub files. A workaround has been added that will detect such
    problematic epubs and then load the font files.
    - fixed a rare crash issue when loading epub files

Sigil v0.3.1 2010.11.07
    - added a new "Font Obfuscation" context menu for font files in the Book Browser; the user can
    now select (or de-select) the use of Adobe's or the IDPF's font obfuscation methods; this also
    resolves the problem where Sigil refused to open epub files that use such obfuscated fonts with
    the message that the epub has DRM
    - fixed a validation issue caused by Sigil using "application/x-font-opentype" as the OPF
    mimetype instead of "application/vnd.ms-opentype"
    - fixed a crash when opening the TOC editor for some epub files (issue #654)

Sigil v0.3.0 2010.11.04

    saved properly (issue #180)
    - fixed an issue with certain path types not being correctly updated as a result of the
    fix for issue #501 (issue #561)
    - the Book Browser now prevents adding files that already exist in the epub
    - previously, when adding external XHTML files through the Book Browser, any files (like CSS
    stylesheets or images) that were linked from that file were included in the epub under a
    different name if their original name was "taken"; this caused duplicates so this behavior
    has changed: files whose names are "taken" are now skipped over (issue #482)
    - fixed a rare issue that caused incorrect path updates for anchor links pointing to file names
    that were suffixes of other chapter file names, and the anchor had a fragment ID (issue #598)
    - fixed an issue with the image paths in background-image CSS rules not being updated when
    the path changes (issue #594)
    - Sigil now informs the user that DRMed files cannot be opened, instead of just crashing
    (issue #624)
    - this time *really* fixed the "acknowledgments" error that was reported as fixed in RC1
    - fixed a crash on load (with an error dialog) issue on Linux systems occurring when multiple
    users on the same machine tried to use Sigil (issue #642)
    - fixed a randomly occurring crash, usually triggered on Macs during loading (issue #643)

Sigil v0.3.0RC2 2010.10.08
    - fixed a file-corruption-on-save issue caused by XHTML files being saved in UTF-8, but
    declared as UTF-16 (issue #617)

Sigil v0.3.0RC1 2010.10.08
    - fixed a validation issue caused by using the American spelling for "acknowledgments" where
    the OPF spec uses the British "acknowledgements" (issue #611)
    - Sigil now uses "application/x-font-ttf" as the media type in the OPF for TrueType fonts
    (issue #609)
    - on Mac OS X, the universal build now includes an x64 version of Sigil, and builds now
    use Cocoa instead of Carbon; support for Mac OS X 10.4 is dropped along with support for
    PowerPC Macs
    - fixed a problem with opening files from the Ubuntu "Open With" menu (issue #524)
    - made Tidy handle common user errors like "&co." in the HTML source instead of "&amp;co."
    - fixed a rare Tidy bug with disappearing spaces when the only whitespace in an element was
    the newline following a start tag (issue #387)
    - changed the internal DOM engine from Qt's QDom to Xerces; this should also bring numerous
    bug fixes and performance improvements plus a small (~10%) decrease in memory consumption
    (issue #367)
    - updated Qt to 4.7: this should bring a 400%+ performance increase in Book View rendering
    along with countless smaller performance improvements and bug fixes across the board
    - switched to the MSVC 10 compiler for Windows releases; should bring ~5% general performance
    improvement
    - fixed several crash/error problems relating to opening, saving and modifying epub files which
    have onerous file permissions set for internal content files (issue #574)
    - added a workaround for broken epubs created by other epub-producing software which caused
    a crash on certain searches with the Find dialog (issue #548)
    - fixed a problem with Book Browser's "Merge with previous" action if a file was previously
    deleted from the Book Browser (issue #565)
    - fixed a problem with chapter splits being placed in the wrong reading order if a file was
    previously deleted from the Book Browser (issue #497)

Sigil v0.2.4 2010.08.12.
    - fixed a problem with updating image paths for images with the same filename but coming from
    different parent directories (issue #501)
    - added a new "Merge With Previous" context menu action for XHTML files in the Book Browser
    (issue #265)
    - changed Tidy to handle the common typing mistake of ending entities with a ':' instead
    of a ';' (issue #535)
    - fixed a bug where double-clicking a file in the Book Browser for a file that was already
    opened in a tab switched that tab back to Book View; the tab now retains whatever View
    it was in previously
    - newly opened tabs now default to the View of the current tab (issue #468)
    - re-engineered the locations where Sigil stores its work files; the system-provided temp
    folder is now used; this should alleviate some permissions issues on certain machines,
    especially Macs (issue #404)
    - Sigil now prevents the renaming of files in the Book Browser to filesystem invalid names
    (issue #493)
    - changed the keyboard shortcut that opens the Replace dialog from Cmd+H to Cmd+Shift+F
    on Macs only; Cmd+H is used by Mac OS X for window hiding (issue #477)
    - fixed an issue with Sigil using XHTML 1.0 for OPS doctypes, instead of XHTML 1.1
    (issue #503)
    - several files can now be marked as having the Text semantic type (issue #522)
    - fixed an issue with Direction: All in book wide searching skipping last XHTML file
    (issue #520)
    - fixed an issue with the declared XML encoding not being picked up if it was wrapped
    in single quotes instead of the more standard double quotes
    - fixed an issue where the user could avoid the warning dialog for book-wide searching in
    Book View if he switched to this mode in Code View, and then switched back

Sigil v0.2.3 2010.06.22.
    - fixed an issue with the new data from one view sometimes not being saved in the final
    epub when switching to the other view
    - worked around a Qt focus issue causing current tab data to sometimes not be saved;
    this was uncovered by fixing the hang-on-save issue, which was caused by the same
    underlying problem (issue #466)

Sigil v0.2.2 2010.06.20.
    - simplified the resource locking mechanism; should eliminate the hang-on-save issue
    - fixed a problem with BookView chapter splitting sometimes not being registered on save,
    causing duplicate content (issue #450)

Sigil v0.2.1 2010.06.18.
    - XHTML files that specify two different encodings are now fixed by removing the incorrect one
    - Sigil now checks the XML encoding attribute for an encoding before the HTML metatag

    - fixed a problem with the opened tabs not being updated until the user gave them keyboard
    focus when a file-wide replace was performed (issue 408)
    - fixed a problem with Book View not reflecting changes done in Code View when the
    Code View was used for editing, and then the tab closed
    - use of custom synchronization primitives should resolve most infrequent hang bugs
    - fixed a problem with the search not progressing in Book View find&replace when using
    recursive replacements

    - fixed syntax highlighting for XPGT stylesheets
    - fixed rare issue with SGF importing that displayed all body text underlined (issue #118)

    properly appears after all images (issue #117)
    - added support for importing images referenced in SVG elements in HTML import
    - HTML importing now defaults to a locale-aware codec if one is not detected in the HTML
    stream; previously the fallback codec was UTF-8; this change should improve importing of
    old HTML documents (issue #113)

Sigil v0.1.3 2009.09.02.
    - implemented a work-around for a bug in Qt causing documents with "us-ascii" encoding

    - fixed an issue with loading HTML files that reference the same images multiple times
    (issue #90)
    - implemented non-live View position synchronization; the Views are now synced
    by HTML element: moving the caret in one View will center the other View (upon switching)
    to the same HTML element that held the caret in the first View (issue #8)
    - newlines are now removed from TOC headings to avoid rendering problems in ADE (issue #96)
    - Sigil now creates a unique book identifier (if one is not provided by the user)
    using the UUID standard instead of a random sequence of characters and numbers;
    the old "SigilGEN" scheme is replaced with "UUID"
    - initial support for calibre interoperability (issue #94)
    - book updates from TOC editor are now faster and have a much smaller memory overhead
    - fixed issue with removing headings from TOC in TOC editor (issue #88, part 2 and issue #21);

    - all headings are now by default included in TOC... heuristics for "guessing" which
    headings the users wants have been removed (issue #88, part 1)
    - fixed critical issue with Sigil hanging when loading certain SGF files (issue #87)
    - fixed rare issue with duplicate image loading (issue #86)

    created after a chapter break to be displayed incorrectly (issue #78)
    - the "makedmg" target for Macs is not build by default anymore and needs to be
    invoked directly; this was done to speed rebuilds
    - Macs now have a standard multiple document interface: opening a new file opens it
    in a new window, not in the old one (issue #22)
    - fixed a bug with warning dialog not informing the user of unsaved changes
    if he tried to load from the recent files list

    - fixed rare issue where CSS style rules could get duplicated when changing views
    - fixed issue with inline style tags in OPS documents not being loaded (issue #58)

    provides support for "Open With..." operating system features (issue #63)
    - fixed an issue where the reported build time in the About dialog was actually the execution
    time (issue #65)
    - loading of missing files in the recent files list is now improved (issue #57)
    - fixed a rare issue where the wrong view could be sent to the printer on print actions
    - Sigil now creates a guide element with a cover page in the OPF if the content of the first
    OPS document is less than 1000 characters long (issue #48)
    - support for importing UTF-16 encoded documents (not just UTF-8)
    - provided install target for Linux; the binary is now also named "sigil"
    (lower case 's') on Unix systems (except Mac) for the sake of convention (issue #46)
    - removed dependency on "data" directory (issue #51)
