Sigil v0.4.0 ß1 2011.03.20
    - fixed an issue with CSS @import rules in the '@import "something.css"' format not being

    - fixed a rare issue with no tab opened by default when loading epubs
    - made the sigil.sh startup script more robust (courtesy of Craig Sanders) (issue #737) 

Sigil v0.3.4 2011.01.12.
    - fixed a regression ("Not a folder" error) with opening certain epub files on Mac and 
    Linux systems (issue #731) 

Sigil v0.3.3 2011.01.06.
    - added a small "Donate" button to the toolbar and a related entry in the Help menu 
    - added a .desktop file for the make install target (courtesy of Richard Gibert)
    - this time *really* worked around a Tidy bug that added blank lines to the start of <pre> 
    and <style> elements (issue #655)
    - updated ZipArchive from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0
    - fixed a regression crash bug with loading extremely rare HTML content documents that have

    - fixed a rare input truncation problem when the input file contains a unicode nbsp and also
    specifies standalone="yes" in the XML declaration (issue #677)

Sigil v0.3.2 2010.11.24.
    - added a new toolbar button for turning Tidy cleaning on/off; this option is also available
    from the Tools menu (issue #553)
    - added support for TrueType Collection fonts with extension TTC
    - InDesign (as of CS5) refuses to list the fonts it embeds in the OPF manifest of the epub 
    files it exports, even though the epub standard demands it. This causes Sigil to not pick up
    these fonts when opening such epub files. A workaround has been added that will detect such
    problematic epubs and then load the font files.
    - fixed a rare crash issue when loading epub files

Sigil v0.3.1 2010.11.07
    - added a new "Font Obfuscation" context menu for font files in the Book Browser; the user can
    now select (or de-select) the use of Adobe's or the IDPF's font obfuscation methods; this also
    resolves the problem where Sigil refused to open epub files that use such obfuscated fonts with  
    the message that the epub has DRM
    - fixed a validation issue caused by Sigil using "application/x-font-opentype" as the OPF
    mimetype instead of "application/vnd.ms-opentype"
    - fixed a crash when opening the TOC editor for some epub files (issue #654)

    saved properly (issue #180)    
    - fixed an issue with certain path types not being correctly updated as a result of the 
    fix for issue #501 (issue #561)
    - the Book Browser now prevents adding files that already exist in the epub
    - previously, when adding external XHTML files through the Book Browser, any files (like CSS 
    stylesheets or images) that were linked from that file were included in the epub under a 
    different name if their original name was "taken"; this caused duplicates so this behavior 
    has changed: files whose names are "taken" are now skipped over (issue #482)    
    - fixed a rare issue that caused incorrect path updates for anchor links pointing to file names
    that were suffixes of other chapter file names, and the anchor had a fragment ID (issue #598)  
    - fixed an issue with the image paths in background-image CSS rules not being updated when
    the path changes (issue #594)
    - Sigil now informs the user that DRMed files cannot be opened, instead of just crashing
    (issue #624)
    - this time *really* fixed the "acknowledgments" error that was reported as fixed in RC1
    - fixed a crash on load (with an error dialog) issue on Linux systems occurring when multiple
    users on the same machine tried to use Sigil (issue #642)
    - fixed a randomly occurring crash, usually triggered on Macs during loading (issue #643) 

Sigil v0.3.0RC2 2010.10.08
    - fixed a file-corruption-on-save issue caused by XHTML files being saved in UTF-8, but
    declared as UTF-16 (issue #617)

Sigil v0.3.0RC1 2010.10.08
    - fixed a validation issue caused by using the American spelling for "acknowledgments" where
    the OPF spec uses the British "acknowledgements" (issue #611)
    - Sigil now uses "application/x-font-ttf" as the media type in the OPF for TrueType fonts
    (issue #609)
    - on Mac OS X, the universal build now includes an x64 version of Sigil, and builds now
    use Cocoa instead of Carbon; support for Mac OS X 10.4 is dropped along with support for
    PowerPC Macs
    - fixed a problem with opening files from the Ubuntu "Open With" menu (issue #524)
    - made Tidy handle common user errors like "&co." in the HTML source instead of "&amp;co."
    - fixed a rare Tidy bug with disappearing spaces when the only whitespace in an element was 
    the newline following a start tag (issue #387)
    - changed the internal DOM engine from Qt's QDom to Xerces; this should also bring numerous
    bug fixes and performance improvements plus a small (~10%) decrease in memory consumption
    (issue #367)
    - updated Qt to 4.7: this should bring a 400%+ performance increase in Book View rendering 
    along with countless smaller performance improvements and bug fixes across the board
    - switched to the MSVC 10 compiler for Windows releases; should bring ~5% general performance 
    improvement 
    - fixed several crash/error problems relating to opening, saving and modifying epub files which
    have onerous file permissions set for internal content files (issue #574)
    - added a workaround for broken epubs created by other epub-producing software which caused
    a crash on certain searches with the Find dialog (issue #548)
    - fixed a problem with Book Browser's "Merge with previous" action if a file was previously 
    deleted from the Book Browser (issue #565)
    - fixed a problem with chapter splits being placed in the wrong reading order if a file was
    previously deleted from the Book Browser (issue #497)

Sigil v0.2.4 2010.08.12.
    - fixed a problem with updating image paths for images with the same filename but coming from
    different parent directories (issue #501)
    - added a new "Merge With Previous" context menu action for XHTML files in the Book Browser
    (issue #265)
    - changed Tidy to handle the common typing mistake of ending entities with a ':' instead
    of a ';' (issue #535)
    - fixed a bug where double-clicking a file in the Book Browser for a file that was already 
    opened in a tab switched that tab back to Book View; the tab now retains whatever View
    it was in previously
    - newly opened tabs now default to the View of the current tab (issue #468)
    - re-engineered the locations where Sigil stores its work files; the system-provided temp
    folder is now used; this should alleviate some permissions issues on certain machines,
    especially Macs (issue #404)
    - Sigil now prevents the renaming of files in the Book Browser to filesystem invalid names
    (issue #493)
    - changed the keyboard shortcut that opens the Replace dialog from Cmd+H to Cmd+Shift+F
    on Macs only; Cmd+H is used by Mac OS X for window hiding (issue #477)
    - fixed an issue with Sigil using XHTML 1.0 for OPS doctypes, instead of XHTML 1.1
    (issue #503)
    - several files can now be marked as having the Text semantic type (issue #522)
    - fixed an issue with Direction: All in book wide searching skipping last XHTML file 
    (issue #520)
    - fixed an issue with the declared XML encoding not being picked up if it was wrapped
    in single quotes instead of the more standard double quotes
    - fixed an issue where the user could avoid the warning dialog for book-wide searching in
    Book View if he switched to this mode in Code View, and then switched back

Sigil v0.2.3 2010.06.22.
    - fixed an issue with the new data from one view sometimes not being saved in the final
    epub when switching to the other view
    - worked around a Qt focus issue causing current tab data to sometimes not be saved;
    this was uncovered by fixing the hang-on-save issue, which was caused by the same 
    underlying problem (issue #466)

Sigil v0.2.2 2010.06.20.
    - simplified the resource locking mechanism; should eliminate the hang-on-save issue
    - fixed a problem with BookView chapter splitting sometimes not being registered on save,
    causing duplicate content (issue #450)

Sigil v0.2.1 2010.06.18.
    - XHTML files that specify two different encodings are now fixed by removing the incorrect one
    - Sigil now checks the XML encoding attribute for an encoding before the HTML metatag

    - fixed an issue with XPGT resources sometimes being saved blank (issue #433)
    - fixed a regression that made it impossible to add removed headings back into the TOC
    (issue #439)
    - fixed a problem with some file-wide replacements reverting
    - fixed a problem with the opened tabs not being updated until the user gave them keyboard
    focus when a file-wide replace was performed (issue 408)
    - fixed a problem with Book View not reflecting changes done in Code View when the
    Code View was used for editing, and then the tab closed
    - use of custom synchronization primitives should resolve most infrequent hang bugs
    - fixed a problem with the search not progressing in Book View find&replace when using
    recursive replacements
    - fixed an issue with inserting images that have apostrophes in the filename (issue #391)

    formed metadata elements (issue #325)

Sigil v0.2.0 ß3 2010.03.23.
    - added two new WYSIWYG actions that work for both Views: "Insert SGF Chapter Marker" which
    inserts the old SGF horizontal rule chapter breaking marker and "Split On SGF Chapter Markers"
    which splits the current chapter according to the placement of these markers (issue #262)
    - chapter splitting now works in Code View
    - fixed an issue with Sigil adding "xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'" to every element
    when performing a chapter break operation (issue #313)

    when the Code View is first opened; the problem affected mostly Mac machines (issue #290)
    - Sigil now handles corrupt epub files with an OPF referencing non-existent files (issue #289)
    - the Book Browser now doesn't scroll back to the top when an item is deleted or added

    be valid XML (issue #248)
    - the "container.xml" reading subsystem now handles XML files with namespaces (issue #235)
