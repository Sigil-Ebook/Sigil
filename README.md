Issue Tracker
=============

Please do not use the issue tracker to ask questions.  Both of the main developers
of Sigil monitor the Sigil Forum at https://www.mobileread.com/forums.
All questions should be directed there.

Issue tracking is intended for discussion around issues with the code. 
It is also intended for actual bug tracking and for tracking feature requests.

Feature requests opened on the issue tracker will be closed if there isn't
anyone willing to implement the requested feature. Only items being worked
will be left open.


Linux Build and Install
=======================

For newer Linux systems like Ubuntu 16.04 (and its derivatives: like Mint 18), or Arch Linux, or Debian Unstable, you should be able to compile Sigil using repo-provided dependencies. Instructions for doing so can be found in:

> [docs/Building_on_Linux.md](./docs/Building_on_Linux.md) ([or .html](./docs/Building_on_Linux.html))

For older Linux systems whose software repositories do not provide Qt5.4.0 (or higher), the
detailed instructions for building/installing Sigil can be found in:

> [docs/Building_on_older_Linux.md](./docs/Building_on_older_Linux.md) ([or .html](./docs/Building_on_older_Linux.html))

For Building on Mac OS X
========================

Building using purely XCode is no longer supported on Mac OS X.  The easiest 
way to build Sigil on Mac OS X is to use cmake 3.0 and the command line.   

Also because Sigil now embeds Python 3.7.2, see  

> [docs/Building_A_Relocatable_Python_3.7_Framework_on_MacOSX.txt](./docs/Building_A_Relocatable_Python_3.7_Framework_on_MacOSX.txt)

for detailed instructions on how to build a fully relocatable Python 3.7.X framework before
building Sigil.  

Sigil uses Qt-5.12.3 currently and will move to Qt-5.12.4 for the next release, see  

> [docs/Building_Qt5_From_Source_on_MacOSX.txt](./docs/Building_Qt5_From_Source_on_MacOSX.txt)


And finally to build Sigil itself see:

> [docs/Building_Sigil_On_MacOSX.txt](./docs/Building_Sigil_On_MacOSX.txt)


For Building on Windows
========================

To build Sigil on Windows, see:

> [docs/Building_Sigil_on_Windows.md](./docs/Building_Sigil_on_Windows.md) ([or .html](./docs/Building_Sigil_on_Windows.html))
