# Prerequisites

# Your may need to have the packaging module installed on your python3
# and instll setuptools module
# pip3 install --upgrade packaging
# pip3 install --upgrade setuptools

# You will need libclang (although macOS has this lib pre-installed, it can *not* 
# be found by Qt's cmake.  Qt has pre-build binaries ready to be used for each platform.
# I recommend storing it someplace *outside* the normal path such as in /opt to help 
# prevent future name clash issues.
# Download  libclang-release_19.1.6-based-macos-universal.7z from:
#       https://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/libclang/
# cd /opt
# and unpack libclang-release_19.1.6-based-macos-universal.7z in /opt to create /opt/libclang

# Tell the pyside6 build where to find it
export CLANG_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/libclang

# You should now be ready to build pyside6
