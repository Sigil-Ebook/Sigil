# Building_Qt6.9.3_From_Source_on_MacOSX

On Ventura you need XCode 14.3.1 or later

# *** IMPORTANT ***
# We do highly recommend you use the same Qt versions as official Sigil builds on Mac OS X.
# which is now Qt 6.9.3

# These instructions will lead you through building from source
# set the deployment target (this is minimum needed)

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0  # now set to 12.0

# cd to a location to store your src tree then do
export MYQTSRC=`pwd`


# Build Prerequisites
# -------------------

1. Make sure you have installed Python 3.13.1 or later and then use pip3 install html5lib as these
are needed by QtWebEngine

2. Make sure you have installed the ninja build tool into /usr/local (or use MacPorts).


# Next build and install the following prerequisites for the build: 
#      cmake, libpng, libjpeg-turbo, openssl3, nodejs (see https://nodejs.org/en/download/), 
#      ninja build tool
# Note: older versions of these prerequisites may work but have not been tested

# Download cmake 3.31.5 or later from https://cmake.org/download
tar -zxvf support/cmake-3.31.5.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.31.5
./bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local -- -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release

# DO NOT BUILD THIS FOR QT - causes bad mixing of libpng versions
# Download libpng 1.6.50 or later from png's sourceforge site: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

# Building Qt6.9.3 from source
# -----------------------------

# download qt-everywhere-src-6.9.3.tar.xz directly from Qt
# from:  https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/
# for: PySide - https://download.qt.io/official_releases/QtForPython/


# alternatively use git to check out the source
# ---------------------------------------------
# git clone https://code.qt.io/qt/qt5.git qt6
# cd qt6
# git switch 6.9.3
# perl init-repository --branch

# without '--branch' specified, init-repository pulls a fixed set of shas
# determined at the time of branch first creation and not the current branch
# heads.  This creates the potential to miss late cherry-picked bug fix 
# commits made to the branch after first creation
