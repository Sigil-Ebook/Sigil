.TH PCRE2_JIT_COMPILE 3 "22 August 2024" "PCRE2 10.46"
.SH NAME
PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.rs
.sp
.B #include <pcre2.h>
.PP
.nf
.B int pcre2_jit_compile(pcre2_code *\fIcode\fP, uint32_t \fIoptions\fP);
.fi
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function requests JIT compilation, which, if the just-in-time compiler is
available, further processes a compiled pattern into machine code that executes
much faster than the \fBpcre2_match()\fP interpretive matching function. Full
details are given in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcre2jit\fP
.\"
documentation.
.P
The availability of JIT support can be tested by calling
\fBpcre2_compile_jit()\fP with a single option PCRE2_JIT_TEST_ALLOC (the
code argument is ignored, so a NULL value is accepted). Such a call
returns zero if JIT is available and has a working allocator. Otherwise
it returns PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY if JIT is available but cannot allocate
executable memory, or PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_UNSUPPORTED if JIT support is not
compiled.
.P
Otherwise, the first argument must be a pointer that was returned by a
successful call to \fBpcre2_compile()\fP, and the second must contain one or
more of the following bits:
.sp
  PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE      compile code for full matching
  PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT  compile code for soft partial matching
  PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD  compile code for hard partial matching
.sp
There is also an obsolete option called PCRE2_JIT_INVALID_UTF, which has been
superseded by the \fBpcre2_compile()\fP option PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF. The old
option is deprecated and may be removed in the future.
.P
The yield of the function when called with any of the three options above is 0
for success, or a negative error code otherwise. In particular,
PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION is returned if JIT is not supported or if an unknown
bit is set in \fIoptions\fP. The function can also return PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY
if JIT is unable to allocate executable memory for the compiler, even if it was
because of a system security restriction. In a few cases, the function may
return with PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_UNSUPPORTED for unsupported features.
.P
There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcre2api\fP
.\"
page and a description of the POSIX API in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcre2posix\fP
.\"
page.
