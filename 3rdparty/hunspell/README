# About Hunspell

Hunspell is a free spell checker and morphological analyzer library
and command-line tool, licensed under LGPL/GPL/MPL tri-license.

Hunspell is used by LibreOffice office suite, free browsers, like
Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, and other tools and OSes, like
Linux distributions and macOS. It is also a command-line tool for
Linux, Unix-like and other OSes.

It is designed for quick and high quality spell checking and
correcting for languages with word-level writing system,
including languages with rich morphology, complex word compounding
and character encoding.

Hunspell interfaces: Ispell-like terminal interface using Curses
library, Ispell pipe interface, C++/C APIs and shared library, also
with existing language bindings for other programming languages.

Hunspell's code base comes from OpenOffice.org's MySpell library,
developed by Kevin Hendricks (originally a C++ reimplementation of
spell checking and affixation of Geoff Kuenning's International
Ispell from scratch, later extended with eg. n-gram suggestions),
see http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/MySpell-3.zip, and
its README, CONTRIBUTORS and license.readme (here: license.myspell) files.

Main features of Hunspell library, developed by László Németh:

  - Unicode support
  - Highly customizable suggestions: word-part replacement tables and
    stem-level phonetic and other alternative transcriptions to recognize
    and fix all typical misspellings, don't suggest offensive words etc.
  - Complex morphology: dictionary and affix homonyms; twofold affix
    stripping to handle inflectional and derivational morpheme groups for
    agglutinative languages, like Azeri, Basque, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian,
    Turkish; 64 thousand affix classes with arbitrary number of affixes;
    conditional affixes, circumfixes, fogemorphemes, zero morphemes,
    virtual dictionary stems, forbidden words to avoid overgeneration etc.
  - Handling complex compounds (for example, for Finno-Ugric, German and
    Indo-Aryan languages): recognizing compounds made of arbitrary
    number of words, handle affixation within compounds etc.
  - Custom dictionaries with affixation
  - Stemming
  - Morphological analysis (in custom item and arrangement style)
  - Morphological generation
  - SPELLML XML API over plain spell() API function for easier integration
    of stemming, morpological generation and custom dictionaries with affixation
  - Language specific algorithms, like special casing of Azeri or Turkish
    dotted i and German sharp s, and special compound rules of Hungarian.

Main features of Hunspell command line tool, developed by László Németh:

  - Reimplementation of quick interactive interface of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell
  - Parsing formats: text, OpenDocument, TeX/LaTeX, HTML/SGML/XML, nroff/troff
  - Custom dictionaries with optional affixation, specified by a model word
  - Multiple dictionary usage (for example hunspell -d en_US,de_DE,de_medical)
  - Various filtering options (bad or good words/lines)
  - Morphological analysis (option -m)
  - Stemming (option -s)

See man hunspell, man 3 hunspell, man 5 hunspell for complete manual.

# Dependencies

Build only dependencies:

    g++ make autoconf automake autopoint libtool

Runtime dependencies:

|               | Mandatory        | Optional         |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
|libhunspell    |                  |                  |
|hunspell tool  | libiconv gettext | ncurses readline |

# Compiling on GNU/Linux and Unixes

We first need to download the dependencies. On Linux, `gettext` and
`libiconv` are part of the standard library. On other Unixes we
need to manually install them.

For Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install autoconf automake autopoint libtool

Then run the following commands:

    autoreconf -vfi
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

For dictionary development, use the `--with-warnings` option of
configure.

For interactive user interface of Hunspell executable, use the
`--with-ui` option.

Optional developer packages:

  - ncurses (need for --with-ui), eg. libncursesw5 for UTF-8
  - readline (for fancy input line editing, configure parameter:
    --with-readline)

In Ubuntu, the packages are:

    libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev

# Compiling on OSX and macOS

On macOS for compiler always use `clang` and not `g++` because Homebrew
dependencies are build with that.

    brew install autoconf automake libtool gettext
    brew link gettext --force

Then run:

    autoreconf -vfi
    ./configure
    make

# Compiling on Windows

## Compiling with Mingw64 and MSYS2

Download Msys2, update everything and install the following
    packages:

    pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool

Open Mingw-w64 Win64 prompt and compile the same way as on Linux, see
above.

## Compiling in Cygwin environment

Download and install Cygwin environment for Windows with the following
extra packages:

  - make
  - automake
  - autoconf
  - libtool
  - gcc-g++ development package
  - ncurses, readline (for user interface)
  - iconv (character conversion)

Then compile the same way as on Linux. Cygwin builds depend on
Cygwin1.dll.

# Debugging

It is recommended to install a debug build of the standard library:

    libstdc++6-6-dbg

For debugging we need to create a debug build and then we need to start
`gdb`.

    ./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O0 -Wall -Wextra'
    make
    ./libtool --mode=execute gdb src/tools/hunspell

You can also pass the `CXXFLAGS` directly to `make` without calling
`./configure`, but we don't recommend this way during long development
sessions.

If you like to develop and debug with an IDE, see documentation at
https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/wiki/IDE-Setup

# Testing

Testing Hunspell (see tests in tests/ subdirectory):

    make check

or with Valgrind debugger:

    make check
    VALGRIND=[Valgrind_tool] make check

For example:

    make check
    VALGRIND=memcheck make check

# Documentation

features and dictionary format:

    man 5 hunspell
    man hunspell
    hunspell -h

http://hunspell.github.io/

# Usage

After compiling and installing (see INSTALL) you can run the Hunspell
spell checker (compiled with user interface) with a Hunspell or Myspell
dictionary:

    hunspell -d en_US text.txt

or without interface:

    hunspell
    hunspell -d en_GB -l <text.txt

Dictionaries consist of an affix (.aff) and dictionary (.dic) file, for
example, download American English dictionary files of LibreOffice
(older version, but with stemming and morphological generation) with

    wget -O en_US.aff  https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/plain/en/en_US.aff?id=a4473e06b56bfe35187e302754f6baaa8d75e54f
    wget -O en_US.dic https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/plain/en/en_US.dic?id=a4473e06b56bfe35187e302754f6baaa8d75e54f

and with command line input and output, it's possible to check its work quickly,
for example with the input words "example", "examples", "teached" and
"verybaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad":

    $ hunspell -d en_US
    Hunspell 1.7.0
    example
    *

    examples
    + example

    teached
    & teached 9 0: taught, teased, reached, teaches, teacher, leached, beached

    verybaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
    # verybaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad 0

Where in the output, `*` and `+` mean correct (accepted) words (`*` = dictionary stem,
`+` = affixed forms of the following dictionary stem), and
`&` and `#` mean bad (rejected) words (`&` = with suggestions, `#` = without suggestions)
(see man hunspell).

Example for stemming:

    $ hunspell -d en_US -s
    mice
    mice mouse

Example for morphological analysis (very limited with this English dictionary):

    $ hunspell -d en_US -m
    mice
    mice  st:mouse ts:Ns

    cats
    cats  st:cat ts:0 is:Ns
    cats  st:cat ts:0 is:Vs

# Other executables

The src/tools directory contains the following executables after compiling.

  - The main executable:
      - hunspell: main program for spell checking and others (see
        manual)
  - Example tools:
      - analyze: example of spell checking, stemming and morphological
        analysis
      - chmorph: example of automatic morphological generation and
        conversion
      - example: example of spell checking and suggestion
  - Tools for dictionary development:
      - affixcompress: dictionary generation from large (millions of
        words) vocabularies
      - makealias: alias compression (Hunspell only, not back compatible
        with MySpell)
      - wordforms: word generation (Hunspell version of unmunch)
      - hunzip: decompressor of hzip format
      - hzip: compressor of hzip format
      - munch (DEPRECATED, use affixcompress): dictionary generation
        from vocabularies (it needs an affix file, too).
      - unmunch (DEPRECATED, use wordforms): list all recognized words
        of a MySpell dictionary

Example for morphological generation:

    $ ~/hunspell/src/tools/analyze en_US.aff en_US.dic /dev/stdin
    cat mice
    generate(cat, mice) = cats
    mouse cats
    generate(mouse, cats) = mice
    generate(mouse, cats) = mouses

# Using Hunspell library with GCC

Including in your program:

    #include <hunspell.hxx>

Linking with Hunspell static library:

    g++ -lhunspell-1.7 example.cxx
    # or better, use pkg-config
    g++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs hunspell) example.cxx

# Installing Hunspell (vcpkg)

Alternatively, you can build and install hunspell using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
